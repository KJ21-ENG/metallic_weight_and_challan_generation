# Extension Icons

This directory should contain the following icon files for the browser extension:

## Required Icons

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels (toolbar icon)
- `icon32.png` - 32x32 pixels (Windows taskbar)
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels (extension management page)
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels (Chrome Web Store)

## Icon Design

The icons should represent the printing functionality of the Metallic Challan System. Suggested design elements:

- Printer symbol (üñ®Ô∏è)
- Metallic/industrial theme
- Professional appearance
- Good contrast for visibility

## Creating Icons

You can create these icons using:
- Graphic design software (Photoshop, GIMP, Figma)
- Online icon generators
- Icon libraries (Material Icons, FontAwesome)

## Placeholder Icons

For now, you can use any 16x16, 32x32, 48x48, and 128x128 pixel images as placeholders. The extension will work without them, but they improve the user experience.

## File Format

- Use PNG format for best quality
- Ensure transparency is preserved
- Optimize file sizes for web use
